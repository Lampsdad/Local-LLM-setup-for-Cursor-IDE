# Security

This repo starts a **network-listening inference server** and, optionally,
exposes it on the public internet through a Cloudflare quick tunnel. That
is the whole security surface, and it is worth understanding before you
run it.

## The threat model in one paragraph

`llama-server` binds `0.0.0.0:8080`, so it is reachable from every device
on your LAN. When you start a Cloudflare quick tunnel, it also becomes
reachable from **anywhere on the internet** at a
`*.trycloudflare.com` hostname. That hostname is not secret — it travels
over DNS and gets scraped. The generated API key is therefore the only
thing standing between an anonymous request and your GPU.

## What the scripts do about it

- Every start script generates a random key into `api_key.txt` (24 bytes
  from the platform CSPRNG) and passes it to llama-server with
  `--api-key-file`. Requests without a matching `Authorization` header are
  rejected.
- The file is locked to your account on every launch — `chmod 600` on
  Unix, `icacls /inheritance:r /grant:r` on Windows — so other accounts on
  a shared machine cannot read it. A key written before this behaviour
  existed gets re-locked the next time you start the server.
- `api_key.txt` is in `.gitignore`, and CI fails the build if it is ever
  tracked.

```bat
kiln key show           :: print it (generates it on first use)
kiln key rotate         :: discard and regenerate
kiln key set MY-SECRET  :: use a passphrase of your own
```

Rotating takes effect on the next server start, and you must paste the new
value into Cursor.

## What the scripts do *not* do about it

Be clear-eyed about the limits:

- **A quick tunnel has no access control of its own.** Anyone with the
  hostname and the key gets in; anyone with the hostname alone can still
  reach the endpoint and consume connection resources.
- **There is no rate limiting** in front of the server.
- **The key is passed to Cursor in plaintext** and stored in Cursor's
  settings.
- **The abliterated build has had its refusal behaviour removed.** If you
  expose that one through a tunnel, the API key is the only thing
  preventing an anonymous party from using an unrestricted model that is
  attributable to your IP. Think about this before you tunnel it.

For anything beyond occasional personal use, register a
[named Cloudflare tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/)
and put a **Cloudflare Access** policy in front of it. That gives you a
stable hostname plus real authentication, instead of a shared secret on a
public URL. If you only ever use the model from the same machine, do not
start a tunnel at all.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a problem in **these scripts** — a leaked key, a permissions
mistake, a command injection in a launcher — please report it privately
via [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](../../security/advisories/new)
rather than a public issue. I will usually respond within a week.

Vulnerabilities in **llama.cpp**, **cloudflared** or **Cursor** should go
to those projects directly; this repo only orchestrates them.

## Supported versions

This is a small script collection with no release branches — fixes land on
`main`. Pull before reporting.
