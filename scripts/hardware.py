"""
Size a launch to the machine actually present.

Everything in this repo was tuned on an RTX 5090 (32 GB) + Ryzen 9
9900X3D. Hardcoding those numbers means anyone on a 12/16/24 GB card
OOMs on the first run -- or, worse, silently downloads 21 GB of weights
that will never load. So derive the choice instead.

WHY THIS IS PYTHON AND NOT A .bat/.sh TWIN
------------------------------------------
The rest of the repo twins its libraries (lib_variants.bat /
lib_variants.sh) because they hold a dozen lines of data each. This
holds a model registry, a KV-cache model, and a search over both. Two
copies of that drift the first time a quant is added, and the failure
mode of drift here is an OOM on someone else's machine. Python is
already a hard dependency -- download.bat and download.sh both refuse
to run without it -- so this costs no new install.

Callers get KEY=VALUE lines and parse them the same way on both
platforms. If Python is somehow missing, callers fall back to their
previous behaviour (Windows: the arithmetic in probe_hardware.ps1;
Unix: llama.cpp's own --fit on).

THE ARITHMETIC
--------------
Context sizing is arithmetic, not a lookup table. Qwen3.5-architecture
models interleave three GatedDeltaNet layers for every full-attention
layer (`full_attention_interval: 4`), and ONLY the full-attention
layers hold a KV cache -- the linear layers carry a small fixed
recurrent state instead. That is why the context windows here look
implausibly large next to a dense transformer of the same size.

    KV bytes/token = full_attn_layers x kv_heads x head_dim x 2 (K+V)
                     x 34/32   (q8_0: 34 bytes per 32-element block)

    27B: 16 x 4 x 256 x 2 = 32,768 elem -> 34,816 B/token
    9B : 8 x 4 x 256 x 2 = 16,384 elem -> 17,408 B/token
    4B : same attention shape as 9B     -> 17,408 B/token

All three numbers are read off the published config.json, not guessed:
num_hidden_layers / full_attention_interval gives the full-attention
count, and num_key_value_heads x head_dim gives the per-layer width.

Usage:
    hardware.py --detect                 what is in this machine
    hardware.py --recommend              what to download and run on it

#                    (1.5-2x). A better quant that gives it up is a
#                    better model that answers more slowly, and for
#                    agentic coding that trade is not worth making.
#  2. quant rank     Below IQ4-class this model gets noticeably weaker
#                    at tool-calling, which is most of what Cursor
#                    asks it to do. See MIN_QUALITY below.
#  3. MTP precision  q8_0 head over q4_0. A real but small effect on
#                    draft acceptance -- worth less than either of the
#                    two above.
#  4. vision         Ranked below all of it. Nobody points Cursor at a
#                    vision tower; it is a bonus, not the job.
#  5. context        Tie-break. Everything here already cleared the
