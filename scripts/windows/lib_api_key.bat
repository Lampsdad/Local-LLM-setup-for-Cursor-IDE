::  API-key handling for the Windows scripts. Twin of
::  lib_api_key.sh, which the shell start scripts source.
::
::  Sourced, not run:   call "%~dp0lib_api_key.bat"
::  Sets:  API_KEY       the key itself
::         API_KEY_FILE  path to hand to --api-key-file
::
::  Why a key at all: the Cloudflare quick-tunnel URL is public,
::  and llama-server also binds 0.0.0.0. Without a key, anyone
::  who reaches either one gets a free OpenAI-compatible endpoint
::  pointed at your GPU. Cursor makes you fill in an API-key field
::  regardless, so requiring one costs nothing.
::
::  Deliberately no setlocal: the caller wants these back.
