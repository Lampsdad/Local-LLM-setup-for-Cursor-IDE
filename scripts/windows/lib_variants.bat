@echo off
:: ============================================================
::  Variant registry -- the one place that knows what a model
::  variant IS. download / start / launch all resolve through
::  here so a new family means editing one file.
::
::  Usage:   call lib_variants.bat <id>
::  Sets:    V_ID V_LABEL V_REPO V_PREFIX V_ALIAS V_UNCENSORED
::           V_THIRD_PARTY V_MTP V_VISION V_PARAMS V_QUANTS
::  Returns: errorlevel 1 on an unknown id
::
::  Deliberately has NO setlocal -- the caller wants these
::  variables back.
::
::  The registry data now lives in scripts\hardware.py, which is
::  also what sizes the launch. One file knows the repos, the
::  quant ladders and the byte counts, so the sizing arithmetic
::  and the download menu cannot disagree about what exists.
::  This asks it and parses KEY=VALUE.
::
::  The hardcoded base/ablit block below is the fallback for one
::  case: Python missing on a machine that already has weights on
::  disk. The smaller families (9b, 4b) are Python-path only --
::  you could not have downloaded them without Python anyway.
::
::  Why base and ablit share their MTP head and vision projector:
::  huihui-ai's UD-* quants are re-ablations of the same
::  unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF files this repo already used, and
::  huihui states the MTP and vision weights are left unmodified
::  by the ablation. So models\mtp-Qwen3.8-27B-*.gguf and
::  models\mmproj-*.gguf serve both, and adding the second
::  variant costs ~21 GB of disk rather than ~25.

:: ---- registry lookup ---------------------------------------
:: %~dp0..\hardware.py -- scripts\windows\ -> scripts\
:: Two cmd.exe traps are load-bearing here, and both fail SILENTLY
:: -- no error, no output, V_ID simply unset, which is
:: indistinguishable from "unknown variant":
::
::   1. The for/f stays on ONE line and outside any if-block.
::      A multi-line `for /f ... in (` whose IN clause is a
::      backquoted command gets mis-parsed inside a parenthesised
::      IF, and runs nothing at all.
::   2. %PY_EXE% is NOT quoted. cmd re-parses the backquoted
::      command, and a quoted program name followed by further
::      quoted arguments breaks that re-parse. The script path
::      still needs its quotes (the repo may sit under a path with
::      spaces); only the executable must go bare, which is safe
::      because :find_python only ever yields a bare name.
