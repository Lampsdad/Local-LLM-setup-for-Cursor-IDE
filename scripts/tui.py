kiln tui -- the status board and the everyday verbs as a full-screen
terminal app, with an interactive benchmark.

    tui.py      open it; installs Textual the first time

This file only makes sure Textual is there and hands over to
tui_app.py, so it runs on any Python kiln supports and can explain
itself when something is missing.

WHY TEXTUAL
-----------
A full-screen terminal app needs raw keys, redraws and resizing on
three platforms. The standard library's answer is curses, which
Windows does not ship, and doing it by hand with escape codes means
re-solving cmd.exe, Windows Terminal and every macOS terminal
separately. Textual already has: it is the Python counterpart of what
Claude Code (Ink) and Codex (Ratatui) are built on, and it works over
SSH, which a browser page on 127.0.0.1 would not.

WHY ITS OWN VENV
----------------
Textual is the one thing kiln needs that is not in the standard
library, so it goes into .kiln/venv-<platform> inside this checkout,
not into your Python. Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora refuse a plain
`pip install` into the system interpreter (PEP 668), and a private venv
cannot break anything else you run. One per platform, because a
checkout shared between Windows and WSL would otherwise have both
fighting over one. Delete .kiln/ to remove it; the next `kiln tui`
asks again.
